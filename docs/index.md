## About Kinectron

Kinectron is a project by [Shawn van Every](https://github.com/vanevery) and [Lisa Jamhoury](https://github.com/lisajamhoury/).

Additional collaborators include [Stephanie Koltun](https://github.com/stephkoltun), [Or Fleisher](https://github.com/juniorxsound) and [Aarón Montoya-Moraga](https://github.com/montoyamoraga).

This software library uses [Kinect One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect) and allows to live-stream from a Kinect to multiple clients at the same time.

## Setup

To setup a Kinectron server, you need a Windows computer running Kinectron and connected to a Kinect one.

To use Kinectron as a client, you need to include the library on your project.

Here is a [working example](LINK) of a Kinect live streaming.
